## 🐱🐶 Task 3: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier for Cats vs Dogs  

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technology**.  
The goal of this task was to implement a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify images of **cats** and **dogs** using the popular Kaggle dataset.  

---

## 🔹 Project Overview  
- Implemented an **SVM Classifier** to distinguish between cat and dog images.  
- Used **Kaggle Dogs vs Cats dataset** for training and testing.  
- Applied **image preprocessing** techniques such as resizing, normalization, and label encoding.  
- Trained the SVM model on processed image features.  
- Evaluated model performance on unseen test images.

## 🔹 Key Steps  
1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - Downloaded and extracted the Kaggle *Cats vs Dogs* dataset.  
   - Organized data into training and testing directories.  
   - Converted images into fixed size (64x64 pixels) and numeric arrays.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Normalized image pixel values.  
   - Labeled Cats = 0, Dogs = 1.  
   - Split into **training** and **testing** sets.  

3. **Model Implementation**  
   - Used **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with linear kernel.  
   - Trained on image features.  
   - Performed predictions on test set.  

4. **Evaluation & Visualization**  
   - Calculated **accuracy score** on validation and test set.  
   - Visualized sample predictions (cat vs dog images with labels).

## 🔹 Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python**  
- **Google Colab**  
- **Scikit-learn** (SVM, train-test split, accuracy score)  
- **OpenCV / PIL** (image preprocessing)  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)  

---

## 🔹 Results  
- Achieved good classification accuracy on the test set.  
- Successfully distinguished between **cats** and **dogs** using SVM.  
- Visualizations confirmed correct predictions for most cases.

## 📌 Conclusion  
This task gave me hands-on experience with:  
- Working on **image classification** problems.  
- Applying **Support Vector Machines** on real-world datasets.  
- Understanding the importance of **preprocessing** in computer vision tasks.  

It was a valuable step in strengthening my **machine learning and computer vision skills** during this internship. 🚀
