# 🏠 SCT_ML_Task1 - Linear Regression for House Price Prediction

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to build a **Linear Regression model** that can predict the price of houses based on:
- Square footage  
- Number of bedrooms  
- Number of bathrooms  

---

## 📊 Steps Involved
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Select features (`square_feet`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`) and target (`price`)  
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
4. Train the Linear Regression model  
5. Evaluate the model using:
   - R² Score  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
6. Visualize the results with:
   - Actual vs Predicted price plot  
   - Residual analysis  

---

## ✅ Results
- Example Performance (values may vary depending on dataset):
  - **R² Score:** ~0.95  
  - **RMSE:** ~25,000  
- Scatter plot showing how close predicted prices are to actual prices  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `SCT_ML_Task1.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. Check model evaluation metrics and generated visualizations
