# ðŸ›’ SCT_ML_Task2 - K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task is to implement a **K-Means Clustering algorithm** to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.  
This will help the business understand customer behavior and design targeted marketing strategies.

---

## ðŸ“Š Steps Involved
1. Load and preprocess customer purchase dataset  
2. Select features (e.g., annual income, spending score, purchase frequency)  
3. Apply K-Means Clustering  
4. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**  
5. Train the K-Means model  
6. Assign each customer to a cluster  
7. Visualize customer segments using scatter plots  

---

## âœ… Results
- Optimal number of clusters identified using the **Elbow Method**  
- Customers grouped into meaningful segments (e.g., high spenders, low spenders, average buyers)  
- Visualizations:
  - Elbow Curve to determine clusters  
  - Scatter plot showing customer clusters  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open `SCT_ML_Task2.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. Observe:
   - Elbow curve for cluster selection  
   - Clustered customer segments visualization
